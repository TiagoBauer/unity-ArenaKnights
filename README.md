# unity-ArenaKnights
 My first game development. The game is a beat up, where you take the hole of a Knight of any four kingdons. They are Red, Blue, Green and Yellow, these four are trying to prove thenselfs to their kings. So pick up you sword and defeat all arenas! (There also a survival mode for scoring purpose)
 
 Game controls:
                 ->  W  A  S  D to walk;
                 ->  Left mouse button or left ctrl to atack;
                 (Combine these two to unleash a powerfull spin!);
                 -> Esc to pause the game.
                   
Game Objective:
                 -> Story mode: Defeat 10 random enemies in the area to fight against the boss. After you defeat all of them you win;
                 -> Survival Mode: Endless enemies after a few the spawn count increase, with the objective of overwhelming the player with enemies.

To play this game, you have to download the build folder and execute the ArenaKnights.exe.
